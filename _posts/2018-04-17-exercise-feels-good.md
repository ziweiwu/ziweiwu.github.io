# What I've done today
Today, I left home around 3, it is a late start, I really want to be very efficient as much as I can
- 1 hour of workout
    - running(6 lapses)
    - digs(10 reps)    
    - front squat(20 reps)
- Watched lecture on dynamic programming
    - What is DP? (need to watch some other lectures)
    - Fibonacci number (practice writing some pseudocode)    

# What I need to do tomororw
Here are some of things I need to get started tomorrow morning
    - 6:30am: Baidu Internship Written Test
    - 9:30am: leave house and head to library
    - get started on 325 HW3
    - solve 3 leetcode problems    
    - squeeze in a workout tomorrow after lunch or dinner
 
# Thoughts for today 
- Have some confidence in yourself, a good way to achieve that is just to be very productive 
- Manage relationships better, need to express why you want to get a head start for your day, perhaps doing more household duties to justify your absence
- Eliminate distractions, get rid of some more social media apps- Reading is good, keep reading "12 Rules for Life"   
- Learn to say "No"
