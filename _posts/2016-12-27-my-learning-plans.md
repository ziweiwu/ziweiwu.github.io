It's end of the year. I am looking to get the following learning done over the next 1 month.

1. [MIT open course on linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/)

2. [Machine Learning by Andrew Ng on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome)

3. A book that I want to read is [Thing Explainer: Complicated Stuff in Simple Words](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25329850-thing-explainer)
